FontSelectDemo
==============

This Demo app has a font sample window that displays a sample of the
selected font and uses a seekbar to allow scaling of the sample text.

Below the sample window is a listbox that has a small sample of the
various fonts and a checkbox to select the font.

I expect to find fontes under assets/fonts.  Currently there is only one 
font file in the github demo.  simply add the .ttf files you are interested
in to the assets/font directory.  I do a recursive search of assets/fonts
looking for .ttf True Type font files.
